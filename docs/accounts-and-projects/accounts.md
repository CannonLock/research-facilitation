## During meeting

Onboarding discussion outline:
* Tell me about your research in general
* How does computing fit in
* Short term and Long term priorities
* What does computing look like (dimensions) for short term goals
* One program run or many (how many)
* For one program run - how long? How much memory? Input/output? Can the workflow be split? Software?
* If the workflow isn’t OSG friendly -> refer to other computing resources
* At this point describe HTC (vs HPC if they have previous familiarity) and then OSG
* How OSG “affects” their software, file transfer and job submission
