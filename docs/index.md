Welcome to the home page of the OSG Connect Research Facilitation Team documentation

Mission
-------

The mission of OSG Connect Research Facilitation Team is to advance the work of researchers and 
campuses via participation in OSG, through consultations on service selection and upstart, training and 
documentation, and channels for ongoing support.

For researchers, the RF Team supports all use of the [OSG Connect](https://www.osgconnect.net/) service, 
avaiable to individual researchers and research groups working on behalf of affiliation with a US 
academic/govt/non-profit organization.
